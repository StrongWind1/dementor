TUI / Interactive Mode
======================

.. versionadded:: 1.0.0.dev21

Dementor ships with an interactive **TUI** that provides a rich, colour-enhanced command line for
interacting with services. It gives quick access to the most common operations - checking the
environment, querying the database, starting and stopping protocol services and tweaking the
runtime configuration - without leaving the terminal.

Let's take a look!


.. container:: demo

Prompt Components
-----------------

The REPL prompt consists of several segments:

- ``dm(vX.Y.Z)`` - current version.
- ``@<interface>`` - network interface selected for the session
- ``using [<dialect>/<cred-count>]`` - database backend and number of stored credentials.
- ``[Debug]`` - appears only when the session is started with ``--debug``.

.. code-block:: text

    dm(v0.5.0)@eth0 using [sqlite/12] [Debug] #
        ^       ^              ^
        |       |              |
        |       |              |
        |       |              +-------------------- DB backend / credential count
        |       +----------------------------------- Network interface
        +------------------------------------------- current version



The following sections document each built-in command.  All commands are available directly
after starting the REPL (``--repl`` or ``-F``).  Use ``help`` for a short overview and
``help <command>`` for detailed usage.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

Help and Exit
-------------

.. code-block:: console

    help            - Show a list of supported commands.
    help <cmd>      - Show the full docstring and usage for *cmd*.
    exit, quit, bye - Terminate the REPL session.

Database Commands (``db``)
--------------------------

The ``db`` command provides a small sub-command hierarchy for interacting
with the database that stores captured credentials and discovered hosts.

.. code-block:: console

    db creds [--raw] [--credtype TYPE] [INDEX]
        List captured credentials. ``--raw`` prints a plain-text view,
        ``--credtype`` filters by credential type, and an optional
        ``INDEX`` shows a single entry.

    db hosts [--raw] [INDEX]
        List discovered hosts. ``--raw`` prints a simple text view;
        ``INDEX`` limits output to a single host.

    db clean [--yes]
        Remove **all** entries from the database.  ``--yes`` skips
        the confirmation prompt.

    db export [OUTFILE] [--credtype TYPE]
        Export credentials in a hashcat-compatible format.  If *OUTFILE*
        is omitted the lines are printed to the console.


Protocol Service Commands (``proto``)
-------------------------------------

The ``proto`` command controls the lifecycle of protocol modules
(e.g. ``smtp``, ``http``).

Its syntax is ``proto <service> <sub-command> [options]``.

.. code-block:: console

    proto <name> on
        Start the specified service.

    proto <name> off [-y|--yes]
        Stop the service; ``-y`` skips the confirmation prompt.

    proto <name> status
        Show a detailed tree view of the service's threads, IP/port and
        whether they are running.

    proto <name> config [KEY[+][=VALUE]]
        Inspect or modify runtime configuration of the service's threads.
        Without *KEY* a list of configurable fields is shown.  ``+=`` appends
        to a list, ``=VALUE`` sets the field.

    proto <name> reload
        Reload the protocol module (stop, reload the Python module, recreate
        threads, start).


Runtime Configuration (``config``)
----------------------------------

``config`` offers a generic interface to the global configuration parsed from the Toml
configuration file.

.. code-block:: console

    config                - List top-level configuration sections.
    config KEY            - Show the current value of *KEY*.
    config KEY=VALUE      - Set *KEY* to *VALUE* (type-aware conversion).
    config KEY+=VALUE     - Append *VALUE* to a list configuration entry.

.. warning::
   Changing configuration values with the ``proto config`` command only updates the
   global configuration object. Running server threads do **not** automatically pick
   up these changes. After modifying a setting you must either reload the protocol
   (``proto reload <name>``) or stop and start the service again for the new
   configuration to take effect.


Environment Overview (``env``)
------------------------------

``env`` prints a compact overview of the current session environment - network settings,
database backend, logging configuration and general session information.


IP Configuration (``ip`` / ``ipconfig``)
----------------------------------------

``ip`` (alias ``ipconfig``) displays the selected network interface, IPv4/IPv6 addresses,
bind address and whether IPv6 support is enabled.
