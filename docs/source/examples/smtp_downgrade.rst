SMTP/IMAP/POP3 Downgrade
========================

The SMTP/POP3/IMAP server in *Dementor* supports a mechanism to attempt a *"downgrade"* of an authentication attempt
initiated by a target host. This behavior is controlled by the :attr:`SMTP/IMAP/POP3.Server.Downgrade` setting.

.. warning::

    This attack specifically targets the `SmtpClient <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.mail.smtpclient?view=net-9.0>`_
    component of the .NET Core platform. Although `DE0005 <https://github.com/dotnet/platform-compat/blob/master/docs/DE0005.md>`_ marks this component
    as deprecated and advises against its use, this example demonstrates how *Dementor* can be configured to simulate various attack scenarios.


.. tip::

    This attack also works against `MimeKit <https://mimekit.net>`_ due to their design choice when performing
    authentication. **And most importantly, this attack also works for POP3 and IMAP**.

Prerequisites
-------------

First, let's understand how a simple email can be sent using PowerShell on Windows. Some tutorials recommend the standard ``SmtpClient``,
which, while deprecated, is still functional in many environments. Here's a typical example:

.. code-block:: powershell

    $EmailTo = "darth.vader@contoso.local"
    $EmailFrom = "luke@contoso.local"
    $Subject = "Revelation"
    $Body = "I am your father"
    $Server = "MAILSRV"
    $ServerPort = 22
    $Username = "darth.vader"
    $Password = "Anakin123!"
    $Message = New-Object System.Net.Mail.MailMessage($EmailFrom, $EmailTo, $Subject, $Body)
    $Client = New-Object System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient($Server, $ServerPort)
    $Client.UseDefaultCredentials = $false
    $Client.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)
    $Client.Send($Message)

By default, the client won't require secure connections unless ``EnableSsl`` is explicitly set.
If NTLM authentication is available, it will be used **but the client may fall back to weaker mechanisms** such as
``PLAIN`` or ``LOGIN`` if the server offers them or NTLM authentication wasn't successful.


Tricking ``SmtpClient`` into Revealing Cleartext Passwords
----------------------------------------------------------

You can exploit this fallback behavior by configuring *Dementor*'s SMTP server to either accept only plain-text authentication
or simulate a failure after NTLM auth to force the client to downgrade.

1. **Accept only plain authentication (not recommended):**

   Modify the :attr:`SMTP.Server.AuthMechanisms` setting to exclude ``NTLM``:

   .. code-block:: toml

       [SMTP.Server]
       Port = 22
       AuthMechanisms = [ "PLAIN", "LOGIN" ]

   Sample output from *Dementor* after capturing cleartext credentials:

   .. container:: demo

        .. code-block:: console

           SMTP       192.168.56.115            25     [+] Captured Cleartext Password for darth.vader from 192.168.56.115:
           SMTP       192.168.56.115            25     Cleartext Username: darth.vader
           SMTP       192.168.56.115            25     Cleartext Password: Anakin123!

2. **Downgrade after failed NTLM authentication:**

   In environments where clients try NTLM first, you can simulate a failed NTLM attempt and force the client to
   retry using plain-text credentials.

   .. note::

      This only works if the client has the cleartext password available locally. If the credentials are
      provided as NTLM hashes or tokens, the downgrade will fail.

   *Dementor* sends the following response to trigger the fallback:

   .. code-block::

       535 5.7.3 Authentication unsuccessful

   The default Windows SMTP client will retry using cleartext credentials — if they are present.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/smtp-downgrade_wireshark.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Wireshark trace showing SMTP fallback to cleartext auth

      The client reattempts authentication with cleartext credentials after an NTLM failure.


Going Further: Retrieving Credentials from MimeKit
--------------------------------------------------

The documentation for `MimeKit <https://mimekit.net>`_ explains that when authenticating via
the `MailService.Authenticate <https://mimekit.net/docs/html/M_MailKit_MailService_Authenticate_1.htm>`_
method, supported SASL mechanisms will influence how credentials are handled. However, this attack
**will not** work if the client specifies a SASL mechanism directly.

.. pull-quote::
    If the server supports one or more SASL authentication mechanisms, then the SASL mechanisms that both the client and server
    support (not including any OAUTH mechanisms) are tried in order of greatest security to weakest security. Once a SASL
    authentication mechanism is found that both client and server support, the credentials are used to authenticate.

    -- `MimeKit Documentation <https://mimekit.net/docs/html/M_MailKit_MailService_Authenticate_1.htm>`_

Setting up a small program usually costs hours of installing stuff. Once complete, the following script
demonstrates how this behavior is triggered from the client side:

.. code-block:: csharp
    :caption: MailProgram.cs

    using (var smtpClient = new SmtpClient())
    {
        smtpClient.Connect(smtpHost, smtpPort, SecureSocketOptions.StartTls);
        smtpClient.Authenticate("temple.master", "UseTheF0rce");
        smtpClient.Send(message); // message create ommitted here
        smtpClient.Disconnect(true);
    }

By default, no additional configuration is necessary. In the following capture, :attr:`NTLM.DisableExtendedSessionSecurity`
has been set to ``true``:

.. container:: demo

    .. code-block:: console
        :emphasize-lines: 6,9,10
