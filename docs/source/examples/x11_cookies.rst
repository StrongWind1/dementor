Stealing XAuth Cookies
======================

The X11 protocol allows graphical applications to display their user interface on a remote system.
If access control is enabled (e.g., using ``xhost``), the user must supply valid authentication
credentials--known as *X authorization cookies*--before launching the application.

Let's consider the following scenario: A user wants to run a graphical application locally but have it
display remotely on a server named ``UbuntuSrv``. Since the user doesn't know the IP address, they use
the hostname instead:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ DISPLAY=UbuntuSrv:0 <program-name>

On Windows, if the hostname cannot be resolved via DNS, it will automatically fall back to **multicast DNS**
(mDNS) for resolution. *Dementor* can exploit this fallback mechanism to capture authentication cookies.

However, unless explicitly configured, no XAuth data is sent by default. In such cases, *Dementor* will log
an anonymous request:

.. container:: demo

    .. code-block:: console

        # [...]
        X11  192.168.56.1  6000  [*] Anonymous X11 request from 192.168.56.125 (version: 11.0)
        # [...]

.. note::
    A more robust approach to capturing X11 authentication and session data would be a traditional
    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack between the client and the X server.

Using Multicast Poisoning to Capture XAuth Cookies
--------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above, when Windows fails to resolve a hostname via DNS, it will attempt mDNS.
If a user specifies a valid *Xauthority* file when launching their application, the authentication
cookie will be sent **in cleartext** to any host claiming that name.

For instance, a user on Windows attempts to launch an ``xterm`` session directed at ``UbuntuSrv``.
Even if the cookie is correct, *Dementor* will reject access and terminate the session:

.. container:: demo

    .. image:: /_static/images/x11-xterm_remote_display.png
        :align: center

*Dementor* logs the captured cookie like so:

.. container:: demo

    .. code-block:: console

        # [...]
        X11  192.168.56.116  6000   [+] Captured MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 for <missing-user> from 192.168.56.116:
        X11  192.168.56.116  6000   MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1: 8032c808e97ef530a585f4f0c6ed2d5b
        # [...]

You can then manually reuse this cookie to authenticate to the legitimate X server:

.. container:: demo

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ touch ./cookie
        $ xauth -f ./cookie add UbuntuSrv:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 8032c808e97ef530a585f4f0c6ed2d5b
        $ DISPLAY=UbuntuSrv:0 XAUTHORITY=./cookie <program-name>
